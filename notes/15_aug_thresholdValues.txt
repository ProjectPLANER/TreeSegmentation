==============

I have accidentally used the threshold values that I would normally apply to the hard case on the easy case.
The results seem... better?
One of the major differences was that the threshold limit is 19, but was 0 in the easy case.
This would mean that some tree areas may be removed. But the result has a much better clarity. The as the trees are thinner, it opens gaps to allow the ground to fill up as a single basin.
